# Tries to find Gperftools.
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(Gperftools)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behaviour and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  Gperftools_ROOT_DIR  Set this variable to the root installation of
#                       Gperftools if the module has problems finding
#                       the proper installation path.
#
# Variables defined by this module:
#
#  GPERFTOOLS_FOUND              System has Gperftools libs/headers
#  GPERFTOOLS_LIBRARIES          The Gperftools libraries (tcmalloc & profiler)
#  GPERFTOOLS_INCLUDE_DIR        The location of Gperftools headers
